Homework 1.02 - Dungeon Load/Save
By: Edwin O. Martinez Velazquez

1.01:
Dungeon Generations randomly generates a dungeon in a 80*21 grid.
It will randomly generate between 5 to 7 rooms.
The rooms will be of a random size between 3x2 to 6x5. This is due to stability
It connects the rooms using Bresenham's Line Algorithm, making a line to the closest room, then looping the first room connected with the last one to force cycles.
Rooms, Rocks, and Corridors are their own structs.
The dungeon is a 80x21 matrix of a tagged union, containing the tag of type and an instance of room, rock, or corridor.

1.02:
Program now has --load & --save switch.
--load switch has optional parameter to specify which file to load from
--save switch has optional parameter to specify which file to save to
If no parameter for --load it will default to "dungeon". File must be a string, e.g., must contain at least 1 character other than a digit. 
If no parameter for --save it will default to "dungeon", unless --load switch has a specified file. In which case it will save to the file loaded from.
--load and --save can be used together, in which case it will load the file and then save it.
--load cannot be used with a seed. A digit only parameter after --load will be read as a seed and fail
--save can be used with a seed or random seed (no input argument)
File must be in the appropiate format, otherwise program file indicate it is not.
Saving file will indicate if there was any errors in the writing process.
Order of switches doesn't matter.


Usage using time as seed: ./dungeonGenerator

Usage using int as seed: ./dungeonGenerator <number>

Usage for load: ./dungeonGenerator --load <optional file name>

Usage for save: ./dungeonGenerator --save <optional file name> <optional seed>

Usage for load/save: ./dungeonGenerator --load <optional file name> --save <optional file name>
