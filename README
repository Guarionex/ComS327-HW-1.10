Homework 1.01 - Dungeon Generation
By: Edwin O. Martinez Velazquez

Dungeon Generations randomly generates a dungeon in a 80*21 grid.
It will randomly generate between 5 to 7 rooms.
The rooms will be of a random size between 3x2 to 6x5. This is due to stability
It connects the rooms using Bresenham's Line Algorithm, making a line to the closest room, then looping the first room connected with the last one to force cycles.
Rooms, Rocks, and Corridors are their own structs.
The dungeon is a 80x21 matrix of a tagged union, containing the tag of type and an instance of room, rock, or corridor.
